> *Tip:* You can skip any section and return later. At any step, ask the AI for help, examples, or clarification.  
> *If you skip a section, add it to the [Skipped Sections Log](#skipped-sections-log) at the end of this file. This ensures you can easily revisit and complete it later.*  
> *Note:* As part of your project setup, be sure to define or review the six core roles for your team:
>
>
> - Product Manager
> - Solution Architect
> - Frontend Engineer
> - Backend Engineer
> - DevOps/QA
> - Full-Stack Integrator
> This ensures your project is ready for high-performance, collaborative development from day one.
