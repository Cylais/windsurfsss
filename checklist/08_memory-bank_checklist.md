# Checklist for memory-bank (all files)

## Current Content Review

- [ ] Is each memory-bank file (activeContext, decisionLog, lessonsLearned, productContext, progress, projectbrief, systemPatterns, techContext) present and up to date?
- [ ] Are key project decisions, lessons, context, and progress documented clearly?
- [ ] Are updates reflected promptly across all files?
- [ ] Are files cross-referenced where relevant (e.g., decisions linked to context or workflow steps)?
- [ ] Is there a clear owner or protocol for updating each file?

## Improvements

- [ ] Automate updates from shared context or workflow.yaml where feasible.
- [ ] Link decisionLog and lessonsLearned to specific workflow steps, context updates, or session logs.
- [ ] Reference productContext, techContext, and systemPatterns in coding standards and architecture docs.
- [ ] Add links to projectbrief.md in onboarding and README.
- [ ] Ensure templates for each file are visible and accessible.

## Further Enhancements

- [ ] Provide and maintain templates for each memory-bank file (decision entry, lesson, context update, progress report, etc.).
- [ ] Add a changelog for major updates in activeContext and progress.
- [ ] Visualize progress, decisions, or lessons with charts/tables or summary blocks where possible.
- [ ] Summarize recurring patterns or lessons for future reference and onboarding.
- [ ] Encourage regular review and updates of all memory-bank files (suggest review cadence).
- [ ] Suggest automation scripts for periodic checks or cross-file linking.
