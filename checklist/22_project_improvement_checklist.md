# Windsurf Project Improvement Checklist

## Code Quality & Technical Debt

- [ ] Standardize docstring formatting across all Python files
- [ ] Add missing type hints to all method signatures
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation to all public methods

- [ ] Add `__init__.py` files to make Python packages
- [ ] Standardize import ordering using `isort`
- [ ] Fix all markdown linting issues (MD022, MD032, etc.)

## Testing

- [ ] Add unit tests for all modules
- [ ] Set up test automation with GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add integration tests for the memory system
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting (aim for 80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Add performance tests for critical paths
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing for core workflows

## Performance Improvements

- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed entities
- [ ] Add pagination for large result sets in search operations
- [ ] Optimize database queries for large datasets
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Implement streaming for large data operations
- [ ] Add database connection pooling
- [ ] Implement query optimization and analysis

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] Move hardcoded paths to configuration files
- [ ] Ensure all SQL queries use parameterized queries
- [ ] Implement input sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] Move sensitive data to environment variables or secure vault
- [ ] Add rate limiting to API endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization for sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for web interfaces

## Documentation

- [ ] Standardize documentation format across all files
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Document database schema and relationships
- [ ] Create a comprehensive developer onboarding guide

## Redundant/Obsolete Files

- [ ] Review and remove/archive `rules_backup_20250525_040530` directory
- [ ] Rename `Rulecheck;ist` to `Rulechecklist.md` if needed, otherwise remove
- [ ] Review and complete or remove `vendor_checklist.md`
- [ ] Remove any other backup or temporary files

## Infrastructure

- [ ] Consider migration to a more robust database (PostgreSQL)

## Error Handling

- [ ] Standardize error responses
- [ ] Add more detailed error logging
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- [ ] Add monitoring for error rates

## Performance Monitoring

- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
