# Super Dream Team Agent Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your Windsurf agents (Product Manager, Solution Architect, Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, DevOps/QA, Full-Stack Integrator, etc.) are designed, refined, and maintained to deliver at an elite, professional standard—indistinguishable from a world-class human team.

## Role Definition & Mindset

- [ ] Have you defined a clear “mindset” and priorities for each agent role?
- [ ] Does each agent have a documented set of best practices and standards for their work?
- [ ] Are agents instructed to always reference the latest shared context and project standards before acting?

## Playbooks, Prompts, and Gold Standards

- [ ] Are there “playbooks” or prompt templates for each agent, outlining:
  - Typical tasks and deliverables
  - Example prompts and responses
  - How to handle edge cases and common challenges

- [ ] Are there example outputs or “gold standards” for each agent’s deliverables (e.g., sample code reviews, architecture diagrams, requirement docs, test plans)?

- [ ] Are agents regularly evaluated against real-world professional standards (e.g., would their work pass a senior developer’s review)?

## Code Quality, Review, and Documentation

- [ ] Can each agent read, write, and analyze code to a high professional standard (including code review, refactoring, and error detection)?
- [ ] Are agents prompted to always produce well-documented, production-ready, and tested code?
- [ ] Do agents follow and enforce project coding standards and style guides?

## Testing & Validation

- [ ] Are agents responsible for writing, running, and maintaining automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)?
- [ ] Is there a process for validating outputs and catching regressions before code is merged?

## Collaboration & Team Synergy

- [ ] Is the communication style for each agent defined (how they report, escalate, and collaborate)?
- [ ] Do agents have checklists for their responsibilities and handoffs to other roles?
- [ ] Are collaboration and handoff processes seamless, with clear documentation of decisions and next steps?

## Learning, Adaptability, and Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Is there a feedback loop for improving agent prompts and playbooks based on real project outcomes?
- [ ] Is there a process for updating agent playbooks as new best practices emerge?
- [ ] Are agents able to learn from past decisions, code reviews, and retrospectives to improve future performance?

## Team Integration & Project Awareness

- [ ] Are agents aware of project goals, current priorities, and recent changes?
- [ ] Do agents proactively surface risks, blockers, or opportunities for improvement?
- [ ] Is there a mechanism for agents to share insights, lessons learned, and technical debt tracking?
