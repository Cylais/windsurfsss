# Dream Team Agent Setup Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure every agent is correctly launched, linked, and ready for seamless, professional-grade collaboration.

## 1. Preparation

- [ ] Confirm the Windsurf Starter Pack is installed and opened in your desired project directory.
- [ ] Review the project’s `README.md` and onboarding instructions.
- [ ] Ensure all core files (`cascades.yaml`, `workflow.yaml`, `context.schema.json`, checklists) are present.

## 2. Agent Session Creation

- [ ] Identify which core agent roles you need (e.g., Product Manager, Solution Architect, Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, DevOps/QA, Full-Stack Integrator).
- [ ] For each agent, open a new Windsurf window/tab or start a new chat/session.
- [ ] Name each chat/session clearly: “{Role} – {Project Name}” (e.g., “Frontend Engineer – MyApp”).
- [ ] Link each chat/session to the correct workspace/project path.
- [ ] (If using) Add each session to `active_conversations.md` or your own tracking method.

## 3. Agent Initialization

- [ ] Instruct each agent to reference the shared context file (e.g., `context.schema.json`) at startup.
- [ ] Ensure each agent loads and reviews relevant checklists, playbooks, and workflow steps.
- [ ] Confirm each agent’s responsibilities and handoff points using `cascades.yaml` and `workflow.yaml`.

## 4. Collaboration & Workflow

- [ ] Verify all agents are referencing the same shared context and memory files.
- [ ] Test agent-to-agent handoffs (e.g., Product Manager → Solution Architect → Coder).
- [ ] Ensure notifications, feedback loops, and review steps are clear and functioning.

## 5. Professional Standards & Best Practices

- [ ] Check that each agent is following their role’s playbook and checklist.
- [ ] Confirm all code, documentation, and decisions are logged and cross-referenced as per project standards.
- [ ] Ensure session names, logs, and chat links are clear and traceable.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Maintenance

- [ ] If an agent is not linked correctly, relaunch the session or update the linking file.
- [ ] For any confusion, refer to the onboarding guide or FAQ section.
- [ ] Periodically review and update checklists, playbooks, and context as the project evolves.

## 7. Before Sharing or Deploying

- [ ] Remove or exclude any dev-only files (e.g., `active_conversations.md`, `chat_link.md`) from version control and distributed packs.
- [ ] Confirm the starter pack remains clean, generic, and ready for others to use.
