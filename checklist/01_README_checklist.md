## Shared Context File Checklist

- [ ] Is there a single, structured shared context file (e.g., shared-context.ts or context.schema.json) that acts as the source of truth for project context?

- [ ] Is the context file regularly updated with new decisions, requirements, and code snippets?
- [ ] Are changes to the context file communicated or logged for team awareness?

## Further Enhancements
