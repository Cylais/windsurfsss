# Session Management

> **Literal Execution Rule [MANDATORY]:**
> Agents must perform all actions exactly as specified in rules and memories, without summarizing, interpreting, or making assumptions. Explanations or summaries are only allowed when explicitly requested. Any deviation is a protocol violation.
> **Exhaustive File Analysis Rule [MANDATORY]:**
> Whenever the user explicitly requests a file to be analyzed, checked, or reviewed, the agent must perform a deep dive and exhaustive review of every single line of the file. This includes checking for legacy references, deprecated instructions, hidden inconsistencies, and any content that may be out of alignment with current protocols or project structure. Partial or summary reviews are not permitted unless the user specifically requests a summary or limited-scope check.
> **Cross-Reference Protocol:**
> When files or folders are moved or renamed (especially in `docs/`, `config/`, `scripts/`), update all cross-references and documentation links accordingly.

## Agent Action and Explanation Rule

The agent must always perform the requested tasks literally and directly, without providing explanations or commentary before or during execution, unless the user explicitly requests an explanation (e.g., by saying "Explain this to me"). After completing the task(s), the agent must provide a brief summary or explanation of what was done.

## Session Start Protocol (Trigger)

- The Session Start Protocol is triggered only if a user, agent, or system message contains the exact phrase "Start Session" (case sensitive).
- If a message contains a similar phrase (e.g., "session start", "begin session", "start the session", etc.), the agent must ask: "Did you mean to start the Start Session Protocol?" before proceeding.

## Session Start Protocol (Actions)

### 1. Discover and Read All Rules, Memory, and Context Files

- **Find and list all relevant files:**
  - All rule files in `rules/` (e.g., `memory.rules.md`, `session_management.rules.md`, etc.)
  - All core memory and context files in `memory-bank/` (e.g., `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `lessonsLearned.md`, `votes.md`, etc.)
  - System documentation (e.g., `MEMORY_SYSTEM.md`, `README.md` in root and memory-bank)
- **For each file:**
  - Open and read the file contents
  - Summarize key points, requirements, and current project state
  - Document evidence of reading (e.g., file list, checksums, or brief summaries in the session log)
- Internalize naming conventions, retention policies, relationship types, agent protocols, etc.

### 2. Internalize and Commit to All Rules and Protocols

- Explicitly acknowledge understanding and intent to obey all rules and protocols for the session
- Record in session memory/log which rules and protocols are in force
- Example: "I have read and internalized the following rules and protocols for this session: memory system rules, session management, collaboration, workflow, technical, and security protocols. I will obey and reference these in all actions."
- Attach evidence: log entry, file references, or memory snapshot

### 3. Initialize the Dual-Layer Memory System

- **File-Based Layer:**
  - Verify `memory-bank/` is present, readable, and writable
  - Confirm all core markdown files are accessible (list files and check read/write status)
- **SQLite Database Layer:**
  - Ensure `windsurf_memory.db` exists and is accessible
  - Start/connect to the local SQLite server if needed
  - Verify schema and tables are present (output schema/tables or DB status)
- **Unified Memory Interface:**
  - Import and instantiate the unified memory interface (`unified_memory.py`)
  - Confirm the interface can read/write both layers (show test read/write evidence)

### 4. Synchronize and Validate Both Memory Layers

- Run the sync tool (`sync_memory.py --check` or equivalent)
  - Check for:
    - Out-of-sync files/records
    - Unresolved conflicts in `_conflicts/`
    - Errors in `logs/memory_sync.log` and `logs/memory_system.log`
- If issues are found:
  - Resolve per protocol (file layer precedence, log all resolutions)
  - Re-run sync until layers are fully in sync
- Attach evidence: sync log output, conflict resolutions, final sync status

### 5. Load and Refresh Internal Context

- Read all memory and context files into session memory
- Summarize project vision, goals, current blockers, technical context, recent decisions, and lessons learned
- Ensure the latest state is reflected in agent context for this session
- Attach evidence: context snapshot, summaries, or log entries

### 6. Acknowledge Readiness and Commit to Protocols

- State explicitly that the system is initialized, in sync, and all context is loaded
- Confirm that all protocols and rules will be obeyed for the duration of the session
- Attach evidence: session log entry, memory snapshot, or system status report

#### Example Session Start Statement

> **Session Start Protocol Complete:**
>
> - All rule, memory, and context files have been read and internalized (see attached evidence).
> - The dual-layer memory system (file-based and SQLite) is accessible, functional, and fully synchronized (see sync logs/status).
> - No unresolved conflicts or errors found.
> - Project and technical context is loaded and fresh (see context summary).
> - I acknowledge and commit to obeying all protocols and rules for this session.
> - Ready to proceed.

### Tagging

- Use `source: file_based` for content from files
- Use `source: unified` for unified memory-originated content

## Session End Protocol (Trigger)

- The Session End Protocol is triggered only if a user, agent, or system message contains the exact phrase "End Session" (case sensitive).
- If a message contains a similar phrase (e.g., "session end", "end the session", "close session", etc.), the agent must ask: "Did you mean to start the End Session Protocol?" before proceeding.

### 9. Automation Reference

For automation or agent implementation, see [tools/session_end_protocol.md](../tools/session_end_protocol.md) for pseudocode and checklist reference.

## Memory System Management

### Dual-Layer Memory System

1. **File-Based Memory** (`memory-bank/` directory)
   - Human-readable, version-controlled documents
   - Primary source of truth for project knowledge
   - Files include:
     - `projectbrief.md`: Core requirements and goals
     - `productContext.md`: Purpose and problems addressed
     - `activeContext.md`: Current focus and changes
     - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and tech decisions
     - `techContext.md`: Technologies and constraints
     - `progress.md`: Status and known issues
     - `decisionLog.md`: Decisions and rationale
     - `lessonsLearned.md`: Patterns and best practices

2. **unified memory Memory Server**
   - Graph-based knowledge representation
   - Enables semantic search and relationship mapping
   - Automatically synchronized with file-based memory
   - Provides context-aware recommendations

### Synchronization Process

1. **On Session Start**
   - Load all memory bank files
   - Create/update unified memory entities
   - Resolve any conflicts

2. **During Session**
   - Track changes to memory bank files
   - Queue updates for unified memory server
   - Batch process updates every 5 minutes

3. **On Session End**
   - Final sync with unified memory server
   - Generate sync report
   - Log any issues

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Detection**
   - Compare timestamps and content hashes
   - Check for conflicting updates

2. **Resolution**
   - File-based changes take precedence
   - Flag conflicts for review
   - Log resolution actions

3. **Recovery**
   - Maintain sync logs
   - Support rollback if needed
   - Generate reconciliation reports

## Cross-Referencing and Relationships

### File-Based Cross-References

- Use markdown links for file references: `[description](path/to/file.md)`
- Maintain a consistent heading structure for reference anchors
- Update cross-references when moving or renaming files

### unified memory Relationships

- Create explicit relationships between related concepts
- Use standard relationship types:

  ```python
  create_relations([{
    "from": "project:requirements:user_auth",
    "to": "project:implementation:auth_service",
    "relationType": "implements"
  }])
  ```

- Document relationship semantics in `systemPatterns.md`

### Bidirectional Linking

- Maintain forward and backward links
- Update related entities when changes occur
- Use unified memory queries to discover implicit relationships
